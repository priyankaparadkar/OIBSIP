# Objective
**Task-1** <br/>
The objective of a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator is to create a simple program that allows users to input their weight 
and height, calculates their BMI and interprets the result based on established BMI categories. This can help users understand their weight status in relation to health.

**Task-2** <br/>
The objective of a password generator is to create a tool that generates strong, random passwords based on specified criteria.
This helps users enhance their online security by using passwords that are difficult to guess or crack.

**Task-3** <br/>
The objective of a weather app is to provide users with real-time weather information for a specific location.
This app can help users plan their activities by giving them access to current weather conditions, forecasts and other relevant data.

# Key Activities
## Task-1: <br/>
**User Input:** Prompt the user to enter their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters).<br/>
**BMI Calculation:** Implement the formula for BMI:
 BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))*2 <br/>
**Output:** Display the calculated BMI and the corresponding category to the user.<br/>
**Error Handling:** Include basic error handling to ensure valid input (e.g., positive numbers).

## Task-2: <br/>
**User Customization:** Allow users to specify the length of the password and whether to include different character types (e.g., uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, special characters). <br/>
**Random Password Generation:** Use Python's randomization capabilities to create a password that meets the specified criteria.<br/>
**Strength Consideration:** Ensure that generated passwords are sufficiently complex and meet common security guidelines.<br/>
**User Interface:** Provide a simple command-line interface or graphical user interface for ease of use.<br/>
**Output:** Display the generated password to the user in a clear format.

## Task-3
**User Input:** Allow users to input their location (city name or geographical coordinates) for which they want to retrieve weather information.<br/>
**Data Retrieval:** Use an external weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI) to fetch current weather data and forecasts based on user input.<br/>
**Data Display:** Present the retrieved weather information in a user-friendly format, including: Current temperature and Weather conditions. <br/>
**Error Handling:** Handle cases where the user inputs an invalid location or if the API fails to respond.<br/>
**User Interface:** Provide a simple command-line interface or a graphical user interface for easier interaction.

# Technologies and Libraries Used
1. Python Standard Libraries: input(), print(), random, string, requests, APIs<br/>
2. Error Handling: try-except
